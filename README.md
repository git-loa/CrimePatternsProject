This project uses pre-commit to ensure code formatting is consistent before
committing. The currently-used hooks are:

- lack for _.py or _.ipynb files.
- prettier (with --prose-wrap always for markdown)

To set up the hooks on your local machine, install pre-commit, then run
pre-commit install to install the formatters that will run before each commit.
